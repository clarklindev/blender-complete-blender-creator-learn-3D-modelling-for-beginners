# Section 05 - rigging and animation (lesson 71-86)

## 71 - intro
walk cycle - playing animation over and over

## 72 basic animation
- if you have keyframes (not at start) but you want to animate Y, you need to add the position keyframes on start frame too.
- output properties -> set framerate (25fps) would mean 2seconds on dope sheet viewport is 50 frames
- insert keyframe (I) or Key button on dope sheet viewport
- to move keyframes, move mouse over keyframe then Grab (G) -> and drag 

#### ANIMATION STEPS 
1. set timeline at correct position
2. move object
3. insert key frame (i)

## 73 record button
- dope sheet viewport -> record button: if you turn this on, making adjustments will auto add keyframes

## 74 the graph editor
- use graph editor to position elements in relation to origin point
- use duplicate (shift + D) duplicate across time line  
- graph shows object movement over time (duration) 
- pivot to cursor (scale in relation to playhead)
