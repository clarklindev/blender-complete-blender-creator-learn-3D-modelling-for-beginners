# section 06 - cartoon head sculpting (lesson 87-99)

## 87 - intro

## 88 - base shape
- sculpting workspace (show brush names -> drag out button panel towards right)
- viewport overlays -> show x,y axis
- viewport overlays -> show statistics
- viewport overlays -> show origins (only visible in object mode) -> CTRL + TAB (mode menu)
- add uv sphere 

#### turn on x symmetry
- sculpting workspace -> sculpt mode -> main view -> symmetry button -> turn on "x" symmetry

#### adding topology (faces) with remesh
steps:
1. sculpting workspace (CTRL + TAB -> sculpt mode)
2. set voxel size (smaller number more faces) - in sculpt mode -> press R (shows interactive grid overlay - voxel size - good size is 0.06) 
3. remesh (CTRL + R)

#### image reference
- if you want to use an image as reference, SHIFT + A -> image reference
- then right panel -> object properties -> viewport display -> in front
- then right panel -> object data properties -> empty -> opacity -> 50%

#### Grab brush
- ensure symmetry is turned on for X axis
- basic shaping with grab brush (big shapes / structure before detailed shapping)
- resize brush (F -> move mouse)
